= TaskLauncher Kubernetes Sink

The TaskLauncher Kubernetes sink consumes a `TaskLaunchRequest` message, then
deploys and launches a task onto a Kubernetes instance using
the Spring Cloud Deployer for Kubernetes.  With that being said a single
TaskLauncher-CloudFoundry can launch different
tasks based on the artifact that is specified in the `TaskLaunchRequest`.

== Input

=== Headers:

* `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`

=== Payload:

A  byte array containing the `TaskLaunchRequest`

== Output

N/A (deploys and launches task to a Cloud Foundry instance).

== Using the TaskLauncher

The task launcher deploys and launches a
link:https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task[Spring Cloud Task] Boot
application as a task on the Kubernetes Platform based on contents from the
`TaskLaunchRequest` message that it receives. The `TaskLaunchRequest` contains
attributes that are used by the task launcher to execute the task:

* uri - contains the uri to the Spring Cloud Task Boot application artifact
that the task launcher will deploy to the Cloud Foundry Platform.
* commandLineArguments - list of commandlineArguments to be used by the
Spring Cloud Task Boot application.
* deploymentProperties - properties to be used by the task launcher to deploy
the task to the platform.

NOTE: Any message received by the sink, that does not contain a `TaskLaunchRequest` will log an error.

== Build

```
$ ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
$ cd apps
```
You can find the corresponding binder based projects here. You can then cd into one one of the folders and
build it:
```
$ mvn clean package
```

== Examples

The following example assumes a TaskLaunchRequest payload is sent to a default
destination called `input`, the sink retrieves the uri of the task jar, the
command line arguments, and deployment properties from the TaskLaunchRequest,
which it uses to deploy and launch the task. The deployer will use configuration
settings based on your current Kubernetes configuration context.

```
java -jar tasklauncher-kubernetes-sink-<binder>.jar
```
